# ðŸš€ Backend Service (Rust)

## Purpose

The **Backend Service** acts as an intermediary layer between the AI Service and the web-service frontend in the CodeWhisperer architecture. Its primary role is to handle and route API calls, providing a central point for validation, authentication, and request management. This design ensures that communication between the frontend and AI Service is secure, reliable, and scalable.

## Intended Functionalities

- **Request Routing:** Redirects and manages API calls between the web frontend and the AI Service.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that incoming requests are well-formed and meet expected criteria.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Verifies user identity and permissions before processing requests.
- **Error Handling:** Provides consistent error responses and logging for failed or invalid requests.
- **Extensibility:** Serves as a foundation for adding more advanced features such as rate limiting, monitoring, and analytics.

> **Note:** While some of these features (validation, authentication, etc.) are not yet implemented, they represent the intended direction and architectural purpose of the backend service.

## Further Improvements

- Implement robust input validation for all API endpoints.
- Add authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access.
- Integrate detailed logging and monitoring for observability and debugging.
- Provide comprehensive error handling and standardized response formats.
- Support for future enhancements such as rate limiting, caching, and analytics.

This backend is designed to be modular and extensible making it easy to evolve as the needs of CodeWhisperer grow.
